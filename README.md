# Node.js & MySQL

## Overview

In this activity, I created an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL skills. The app takes in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 

## Skills Used

* JavaScript
* Node
* MySQL
* npm packages
    - Inquirer
    - CLI table

## A preview of how it works

The user is provided a list of items, ids, and prices in the MySQL database. They are then asked the id of the item they would like to purchase and how many they would like. 

Once the user has input their selections, a query runs to check the quantity available for the item and amount they selected. If there is enough available, the program will give them their total price and reduce the quantity available by the amount they ordered. 

If there is not enough of the chosen product in stock, a message will show saying there is not enough in stock and ask them to place a new order. 

Here is a giphy of the app:
